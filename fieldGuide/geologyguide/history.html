 <p align="center"><strong>Geology of Pingree Park</strong></p>

<p>
The Earth is ~ 4.5 billion years old.  The oldest rocks at Pingree are ~ 2 billion years old!  These metamorphic rocks, <a href="gneiss.html">gneiss</a> and <a href="schist.html">schist</a>, were once <a href="sedimentary.html">sedimentary</a> rocks that were buried so deep that the heat and pressure compressed and re-crystallized them.
</p><p>
Superheated molten magmas melted their way into the <a href="gneiss.html">gneiss</a> and <a href="schist.html">schist</a> and, when they cooled, they became the <a href="igneous.html">igneous</a> rocks that are the <a href="granite.html">granite</a> cores of many of the peaks around Pingree.
</p><p>
~ 600 million years ago, the area was uplifted into what is known as the Ancestral Rockies.  By ~ 300 million years ago, the Ancestral Rockies had been completely eroded to a level plain of sediments. 
 </p><p>
Then, only ~ 60 million years ago, the mountains were again thrust up to make the present Rockies.  All the sediments they lifted up above them have been eroded away, leaving the <a href="gneiss.html">gneiss</a> and <a href="granite.html">granite</a> cores of the Rockies exposed as they are today.
</p><p>
The Rockies have been glaciated several times in the last 100,000 years, with the last glaciers reaching their maximum only ~ 20,000 years ago.  These glaciers melted ~ 12,000 years ago, leaving the many glacial features in Pingree Park.
</p><p>
The geologic process of erosion continues today, and is  most evident in shaping the meanders, riffles, and pools along the reaches of the Little South Fork of the Cache la Poudre as it winds through meadows and riparian areas.
