   <strong>Description:</strong> The largest members of the family Cervidae, moose are generally a chocolate to reddish brown with slightly paler legs and underbelly.  They have longer front legs than hind, which gives them a sloping stance.  Moose have a long, broad muzzle, and the nose is almost bulbous.  A flap of skin (often called the ?bell or dewlap?) hangs from the throat.  They have large and erect ears, and a short, almost inconspicuous tail.  Total length is 2.4-2.9m, and weight is 380-550kg.  Adult males grow large palmate antlers (?palmate? meaning they have a large, cupped surface, with tines growing around the edges ? kind of like the palm of your hand including your fingers) which grow outward and backward over the neck and back.  These antlers can grow quite large, sometimes exceeding 25kg in mass.  Males shed these antlers annually (usually in the early winter), and begin growing new ones in late winter.  Primarily dependent on riparian vegetation for food, moose are rarely seen far from water.  They feed on a large amount of browse, including stems, bark, buds, and leaves of deciduous or evergreen trees or shrubs in the winter.  Moose are typically solitary and reclusive, preferring to stay within their specific home ranges.  They breed in the fall from mid-September to early October.  During the breeding season, moose will congregate, and males will become aggressive toward each other and may display or fight for females.  Females calve in late May to early June, and usually will have one calf (though females can occasionally have twins in good years).  Moose in Colorado have no effective natural predators.  Most mortality occurs through disease, malnutrition and hunter harvest.  The Colorado Division of Wildlife introduced moose into Colorado beginning in 1978.  Prior to that time, there are no records of breeding populations of moose within the state, only the occasional solitary straggler from Wyoming and Utah.
