   <strong>Description:</strong> This medium-sized bear is Colorado?s largest carnivore.  Black bear color varies greatly from black to brown to even a pale brown or whitish color.  The vast majority of black bears in Colorado are either brown or black in color.  They can survive in practically any habitat, from urban areas to alpine areas.  They are opportunistic, omnivorous feeders, whose diet varies with food availability, with the mainstay consisting of vegetation.  Black bears feed on vegetation, berries, mast (acorns), insects, small mammals, carrion, and have been known to take large mammals such as unwary elk or deer.  They hibernate in the winter months, where they may lose 20 to 27% of their bodyweight.  During hibernation, bears metabolism may drop by 50 to 60%, but their body temperature remains relatively high (around 7-8 degrees C), which allows them to arouse quickly if disturbed while hibernating.  They are typically solitary, secretive animals and will avoid confrontation if at all possible. Black bears are active at any time of day, but are typically most active during the twilight hours (crepuscular).  They will occasionally travel in family groups (sows with cubs), or may congregate in areas of abundant food.  Black bears typically breed from early June to around mid-August.  Gestation is 7 to 8 months, with delayed implantation until November or December.  Cubs are born in late January or February while the mother is usually in hibernation.  Females generally have two or three young, every other year.  Black bears are extremely sensitive to over harvest, mainly due to their low reproductive rates.
