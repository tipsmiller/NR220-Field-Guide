   <strong>Description:</strong> This short-bodied, long-tailed vole (the tail is about one third the length of the head and body) is reddish brown to brown-gray colored vole.  Their ventral color is generally a little lighter in color.  Total length is 174-196mm, and weight is 36-59g.  Long-tailed voles are most commonly found in marshy to dry grassy areas, and can be found in particular abundance in aspen stands.  They are found in most major ecological zones in Colorado, preferring open meadows and grasslands.  Long-tailed voles feed mostly on green vegetation, as well as fruit and seeds.  During the winter, they will feed on the bark and stems of woody shrubs and small trees.  Long-tailed voles breed from mid-April to October, and females will produce around five young per litter.  These are short-lives voles, living no more than about two years, with most mortality occurring within the first year of life.  They are active at all times of the day (and night), and no not create well-defined runways.  Main predators of long-tailed voles include weasels, raptors, and other carnivores.
