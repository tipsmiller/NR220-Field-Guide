   <strong>Description:</strong> The red-backed vole has a broad reddish mid-dorsal stripe from the forehead to the tail.  The background color is a grayish-brown.  The central color is a lighter grayish, with the base of the hairs black.  It has a relatively long tail (for a vole, but in no way as long as the long-tailed vole), which is distinctly bicolored.  Red-backed voles? ears are shirt, and are partially hidden by fur.  Total length is 125-152mm, and weight 20-38g.  These voles are most common in lodgepole pine stands, or in mixed spruce-fir forests.  They are frequently found in areas of pine squirrels (chickarees) and will regularly use the middens they create for cover and as a source of food.  Red-backed voles will also use other habitats such as aspen woodlands, grassy meadows, willow riparian area, talus and krumholtz.  They are opportunistic feeders and will eat a variety of fungi, roots, bark, berries and other fruit seeds as well as the leaves of small shrubs and trees.  Their runways are not as distinct as other species of voles in Colorado, and will create circular (globular) nests of grasses, mosses and other soft materials under objects such as rocks, logs, etc.  Red-backed voles have a high metabolism, and will select habitats where water is abundant.  The breeding season lasts about seven or eight months, beginning in late winter.  Females produce several litters of four to eight young during the breeding season.  They are most active at dusk and during the night during the warmer summer months, and switch to a more diurnal activity pattern during the winter months, moving and foraging under the snow pack.  Red-backed voles have a number of terrestrial and avian predators, including coyotes, foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, and weasels, hawks and owls, as well as other raptors.
