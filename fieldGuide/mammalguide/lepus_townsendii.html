   <strong>Description:</strong> White-tailed jackrabbits are large hares with a white rump and tail.  The upper part of its pelage is a pale grayish brown, with a white rump and tail.  The tips of its ears are black, like the Snowshoe Hares, but can easily be distinguished by having much longer ears.  Its total length is 560-660mm, and adult weight is 2.5-5kg.  They are mostly crepuscular and nocturnal, but can be seen moving about during the late afternoon, and on cloudy days.  In spring and summer months, its diet consists mainly of grasses and sedges, but in colder months, forbs and shrubs become a more important part of their diet.  Like other lagomorphs, White-tailed jackrabbits practice coprophagy (the re-ingestion of soft, specialized fecal pellets for additional nutrition).  The breeding season is March through late August, and females experience postpartum estrus.  In Colorado, White-tailed jackrabbits usually have one litter per year (with an average of 5 young per litter), but more litters in a year are possible.
