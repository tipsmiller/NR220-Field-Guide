   <strong>Description:</strong> The Heather vole is a small vole with a short tail.  They are a brown to grayish colored vole, with a silvery-gray ventral side.  Their tail is distinctly bicolored (dark above and pale below).  Total length is 130-140mm, and weight is 30-50g.    Heather voles are commonly found in stands of fir, spruce, lodgepole, aspen and ponderosa pine, and grassy meadows all the way up to the alpine.  They are most active at night, and forage on green vegetation, seeds, bark f trees and shrubs, berries and fungi.  They will store food in caches close to their burrow entrances, and will use these caches year-round.  In the summer months, heather voles will create shallow burrow systems, creating nests of mostly dried grasses and vegetation.  Snow cover in the winter months allows the voles to create burrows between the snow-ground boundaries.  Most breeding occurs between May and September.  Females will generally produce no more than three litters of five or six (range is from 2 to 9) young per year.  They are active year-round, and do not hibernate in the winter months.  Heather voles are generally solitary, but family groups have been known to huddle together for warmth in the winter months.  Natural predators include the American marten, long-tailed weasels, and many species of raptors.
