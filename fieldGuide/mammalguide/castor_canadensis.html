   <strong>Description:</strong> The American beaver is the largest rodent in North America.  These semi-aquatic mammals can (and sometimes do) reach a weight of over 24kg in Colorado.  Total length: 850-1,200mm, weight: 16-32kg.  Their pelage ranges from a very dark brown to a chestnut color.  They have long, shiny guard hairs, and dense, soft underfur.  The ears are short and rounded, and they have a distinctive flat, scaly tail (which is very sparsely haired).  Having a semi-aquatic lifestyle, they have evolved valvular ears and nostrils, and nictitating membranes over their eyes, and lips that close behind their distinctive red-orange incisors.  ?Nature?s engineers,? they construct distinct, large dams and complex lodges in aquatic habitats.  Beavers are generalists in food habits.  They will eat a wide variety of plant species, but prefer the bark, buds, leaves and twigs of quaking aspen, willows, and cottonwoods.  They will frequently cut these trees down, and store limbs underwater for food during the winter (when the beaver ponds are frequently frozen over).  Their dens have underwater entrances, allowing access to this stored food during the winter.  Beavers are crepuscular to nocturnal in most situations, but are known to be active during the day as well.  Beavers are highly social animals, living in family or extended family units called colonies.  They mate from January to early March, and have typically one litter of an average of 3 young per year.  Predators include wolverine, coyote, bear, lynx, bobcat, mountain lion, and occasionally river otter (though river otter have been known to peacefully share beaver dens for short periods of time).  Prized for their pelts, they have historically been trapped extensively throughout their range, and still are today.
