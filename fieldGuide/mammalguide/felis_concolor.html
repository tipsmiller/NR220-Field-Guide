   <strong>Description:</strong> Mountain lions (sometimes called pumas, cougars, painters and panthers) are the largest cats in the United States (except for the jaguar which rarely enters the US from Mexico).  They are a brown to reddish-brown color with paler ventral color.  The nose pad, backs of the ears and tip of the tail are black.  Colorado harbors some of the largest mountain lions in the world.  Total length is 1.5-2.75m and weight is 36-103kf.  Males are typically larger than females.  They inhabit most ecosystems found in Colorado, with even an occasional report out on the eastern plains.  Most commonly though, mountain lions can be found in the rough, rocky foothills and canyon country of Colorado. They are highly sensitive to human disturbance, and will hunt at any time of the day stalking their prey rather than chasing it.  Their diet is mainly deer (in Colorado, specifically mule deer), though they will prey on elk and moose occasionally.  In some situations, when resources become scarce, mountain lions may feed on mice, ground squirrels, beavers, rabbits, porcupines, raccoons, bobcats, fox, and domestic livestock.  Mountain lions are largely solitary, and set up extensive territories.  Male territories frequently overlap several female territories.  Mountain lions can breed at any time of the year, with most cubs being born in the spring/summer/fall months.  Females will have one litter of an average of two to three cubs every year and a half to two years.  Little is known about natural mortality factors for mountain lions, and most known mortality occurs as a result of human interaction.
