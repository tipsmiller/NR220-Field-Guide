   <strong>Description:</strong> Long-tailed weasels are the largest of Colorado?s weasels.  Color varies from location, but they generally have a distinct darker tan dorsal and light tan to pale white ventral pelage in the summer, and molt to a white coat win the winter.  Their tail has a dark black tip, year-round, and is relatively long (about 40-45% the entire length).  Total length is 318-441mm, and weight is 110-130g.  Long-tailed weasels are common in Colorado, but due to their activity patterns, and lifestyles, they are rarely seen.  They are active year-round, and can be active at any time of day (or night).  These curious weasels will often take cover in a hole when frightened, but will pop their heads out for another look after a few minutes.  Long-tailed weasels feed on a wide variety of prey including all kinds of rodents, rabbits, birds and reptiles.  They have also been known to prey on large bird nests (i.e. waterfowl, grouse, prairie chickens, etc.).  Long-tailed weasels have a high metabolic rate, and will consume between 20 and 40% of their body weight in food per day.  They live in abandoned burrows, creating nests of grass and fur of small mammals. Long-tailed weasels are generally solitary, except during periods of high food abundance and during the breeding season.  Most breeding occurs during July and August.  Delayed implantation occurs, and gestation periods last from 220-237 days after mating.  Females only rear one litter of around seven young per year.  Long-tailed weasels have a variety of natural predators including coyotes, foxes, snakes and raptors.
