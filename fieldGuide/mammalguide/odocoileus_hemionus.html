   <strong>Description:</strong> Mule deer are smaller than elk, with large, very conspicuous ears (this is where they get their name from).  Their color in the summer is a reddish tan, and in the winter a brownish gray.  The rump and belly are white.  They typically have a pale grayish muzzle, and a darker forehead.  Their tail is short and pale with a black tip.  Total length is 1,200-1,675mm, and weight is 70-200kg.  Males are generally larger than females.  Most males produce antlers annually, which project forward and upward (instead of backward, as elk antlers do).  The antlers branch equally, and do not form a main beam.  Males begin producing antlers in the spring and summer months, and shed their velvet before the breeding season (November and December).  Antlers are shed annually in late February or March.  Females do not produce antlers.  Mule deer occupy all ecosystems in Colorado.  They are highly adaptable to many environments, and have a broad diet range as a result.  Mule deer are mostly nocturnal or crepuscular during the warmer months, and become more diurnal during the winter months.  They will often make seasonal migrations from higher-elevation summer ranges to lower winter ranges annually.  Females will generally produce one fawn per year, but older females in good condition will occasionally produce twins.  The greatest mortality occurs during the first winter for mule deer fawns (up to 75% fawn mortality in their first winter is not uncommon in areas of the state).  Mule deer may survive up to 20 years in the wild, though it is rare to find mule deer that old.  Major predators include coyotes, bobcats, Golden Eagles, mountain lions, and black bears.
