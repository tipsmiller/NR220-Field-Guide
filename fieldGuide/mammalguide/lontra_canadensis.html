   <strong>Description:</strong> River otters are fairly large, elongated mustelids that spend the vast majority of their time in the water.  Their dense coat is usually a dark brown to chestnut color, with the ventral color slightly lighter and more yellow.  River otters inhabit riparian habitats, and will traverse great distances across ?dry? habitats to other sources of water.  Their main diet includes fish and crayfish, but occasionally they will east amphibians, small mammals found in or near water, and even waterfowl.  River otters require permanent streams that have at least a10 cubic feet per second flow, though they can use smaller streams for short periods of time.  River otters are active year-round and at any time of the day.  They do not hibernate in the winter and require at least 10% open water in streams and lakes in order to feed.  Otters are social animals, often forming family groups of up to six or seven (more commonly two to four).  They will use terrestrial sites when they are not moving or foraging to rest and preen, and will use dens and other protected areas to sleep in. (Otters have been reported to even temporarily use active beaver lodges for short periods of time.)   The breeding season for river otters is from February to April, and females mate immediately after they give birth.  Delayed implantation most likely occurs with the total gestation period estimated at 290-375 days.  When giving birth, female otters will retreat to secluded dens, (usually abandoned dens of other aquatic mammals), and will not use the same natal den more than once.  Litter size ranges form one to six, with the average around two or three young.  Young otters will remain with the female for seven to eight months, and then can disperse great distances in search of individual territories.  Otters have few natural predators.  The occasional eagle may take young otters, and gray wolves in Canada have been known to specialize in killing otter.  The Colorado division of wildlife initiated a river otter recovery program in the late 1970, which lasted into the mid 1990?s, with one of the focused reintroduction sites being Rocky Mountain National Park.
