   <strong>Description:</strong> Northern Pocket gophers are small gophers whose color varies geographically from a dark brown to pale yellow.  Total length is 165-250mm, and weight is 100-150g.  They are one of the most ecologically tolerant of Colorado?s gophers, and can be found in practically any habitat type.  Gophers have an important ecological function in the development and maintenance of soils.  They create extensive burrow systems with both deep (>40cm) and shallow tunnels in the soil.  These movements allow for the mixing and cycling of soil components, the incorporation of organic matter deeper into soils and the exposing of fresh, parent soil material to the surface.  Their diet consists of vegetation, and they are well known for using all parts of plants as food.  In the winter roots and tubers are diet staples, and during the summer they favor green vegetation.  Northern pocket gophers will cache food in chambers that they close off from the main burrow system.  It is thought that little of this stored food is used by the animal.  In Colorado, northern pocket gophers reproduce from mid-March through June, depending on elevation and snow cover.  Females will produce only one litter of four to six young per year.  Main natural predators of northern pocket gophers include coyotes, foxes, bobcats, badgers, skunks, weasels, snakes and several species of raptors.
