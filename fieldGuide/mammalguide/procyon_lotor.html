   <strong>Description:</strong> Raccoons are stout carnivores with thick, bushy tails and relatively long legs.  The dorsal color is blackish to brownish gray and the ventral side is a paler grayish brown to silver color.  The tail has four to seven dark bands, separated by lighter bands.  They have a black ?mask? around the eyes, which is often surrounded by white hair.  Total length is 600-950mm, and weight is 1.5-22kg.  Raccoons are highly adaptable to many environments, but are most common in lowland riparian habitats, croplands and urbanized areas of the foothills and eastern plains, but are not uncommon in mountainous areas along streams and reservoirs.  Raccoons are generally nocturnal, but can be seen foraging during the day.  They are typically solitary, but may share dens in the winter with two to twelve other raccoons.  Raccoons den in suitable hollow trees, logs, rock crevices, caves, culverts, burrows created by other mammals, brush piles, muskrat lodges, or used or abandoned human buildings.  Opportunistic feeders, the diet of raccoons are highly varied, according to location and food availability.  They are omnivorous, and will feed on berries, seeds, insects, crayfish, birds and their eggs, small mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians (along with various other items they deem acceptable).  Raccoons breed from December to June, with the peak of breeding activity in late January into February.  Litter sizes range from one to eight.  Most raccoon mortality occurs from human interaction and starvation.  Mountain lion, bobcats, wolves, coyotes, foxes and Great-horned Owls are known to prey on raccoons.
