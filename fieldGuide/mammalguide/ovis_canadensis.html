   <strong>Description:</strong> Bighorn or ?mountain? sheep are heavy built mammals whose pelage varies seasonally from grayish brown to medium brown.  Their muzzle and rump is a grayish white.  Males have massive, thick horns that sweep outward, backward, then downward, with the tips curving back upward, eventually forming a ?full curl?.  Mature ram horns can measure more than 46 cm around the base and 112 cm in length.  Horns on subadults and females are considerably shorter and more slender.  Total length: 1,250-1,950mm, weight: 50-125kg.  They are associated with steep, rocky, mountainous habitats throughout the Rocky Mountains.  The bulk of their diet is grasses, browse and some forbs.  Specifically, grasses, sedges and shrubs form the majority of their diet.  These gregarious, social animals are most active during the day (diurnal).  They will make seasonally short migrations from summer to winter ranges.  Bighorn sheep breed in November and December in Colorado.  Breeding is promiscuous, with dominant males typically doing most of the breeding.  Males do not significantly contribute to the breeding population until about 8 years of age.  Most young are born in May or June.  They can live up to 17 years, but most do not survive past 12 in the wild.  High mortality occurs in the first year of life, mainly due to predation (by mountain lions, Golden Eagles, coyotes, and bobcats) and disease.  These strong, majestic, important game mammals in Colorado have led to the adoption of this mammal as the logo for the Colorado Division of Wildlife (and CSU!).
