   <strong>Description:</strong> One of Colorado?s larger rodents, the muskrat is well adapted to its semi-aquatic lifestyle.  It has a large, stocky body with a rounded head.  Its pelage is generally a reddish brown to gray color, and it has thick underfur, which helps keep it insulated in the water.  Total length is 450-550mm; weight is 650-1,800g.  They have valvular ears and their mouth closes behind their incisors, which helps keep water out of the ears and mouth as they swim.  Muskrats occupy practically all aquatic habitats found in Colorado.  They usually live in burrows or dens created in the banks or dams of streams, rivers, lakes and ponds. Their diet consists mainly of plant material, but they will occasionally consume fish, mollusks, crayfish and carrion, when available.  Muskrats are typically nocturnal or crepuscular, and are territorial.  They breed seasonally in the spring and summer months, and females will generally have two litters of an average of 6 young per litter per year.  Natural enemies of muskrats include a wide variety of species such as mink, raccoon, fox, coyote and dogs.  They are an economically important furbearer species in Colorado, and up to 80 percent of managed populations can be harvested without depleting the overall population health.
