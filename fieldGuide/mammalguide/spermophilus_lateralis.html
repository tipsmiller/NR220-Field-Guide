   <strong>Description:</strong> This medium-sized squirrel has a distinct reddish (?golden?)  ?mantle? on its head and shoulders (hence its name ? golden-mantled ground squirrel).  Two white stripes run down its back, both bordered with black.  It has a whitish underbelly, and a white ring around its eye.  Total length is 240-300mm, weight is 170-290kg.  This highly adaptable ground squirrel has a wide range in the west, and is easily observable in any habitat.  They prefer open habitats, and are not often found in heavily wooded areas.  Golden ?mantled ground squirrels feed on a wide variety of foods, with the bulk of their diet consisting of green vegetation, seeds and fungi.  They will occasionally feed on insects, carrion, eggs and nestling birds as well.  Golden-mantled ground squirrels will create extensive burrow systems beneath rocks, trees and buildings.  They breed in the spring, and females usually produce a single litter of around five young per year (range of 2 to 8 young).  Golden-mantled ground squirrels are usually solitary, but they will defend areas around their burrows and dens with aggressive behavior.  They enter hibernation by about mid-October, and emerge in March or April.  They don?t usually live beyond two or three years in the wild, and have many natural predators (including a wide variety of carnivores and raptors).
