   <strong>Description:</strong> The American badger is a short, stout mustelid with an attitude.  Badgers are highly specialized for a semi-fossorial lifestyle (digging, but not burrowing).  They typically dig holes in pursuit of prey, and also to den and rear young.  As a result, they have short, strong legs, with strong claws that help them in their digging.  They have a ?salt-and-pepper? gray/black dorsal pelage, and the top of their head, snout, feet, parts of the legs and ears are black, with a distinctive white stripe running from the top of the snout, down the mid-line of the top of the head.  Total length is 660-889mm, and weight is 6-14kg.  They occur in practically all habitat types in Colorado, preferring open habitats, and avoiding densely wooded areas.  They are opportunistic predators eating any fossorial or terrestrial prey they can capture (mainly prairie dogs, rabbits, mice, ground squirrels, gophers, snakes, lizards, insects and ground nesting birds and their eggs).  Mating occurs from late June to August.  Like most mustelids, they have a characteristic known as delayed implantation (where the embryo enters a state of dormancy for a period of time) extending its gestation period to 7-8 months.  Most females give birth in March or April, and have an average litter size of 2 (range of 1-4).  They are generally solitary except during the breeding season.  Badgers are active at any time of the day, but typically in areas of heavy human activity, they are nocturnal.  They have been known to have prolonged periods of inactivity during the colder months, even entering into torpor for a short period of time.  Badgers have few natural predators as adults, and face danger aggressively (hence the ?attitude?).  Their main enemy is humans, but Golden Eagles, coyotes, and domestic dogs can kill juveniles.
