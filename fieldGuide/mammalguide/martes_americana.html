   <strong>Description:</strong> The American marten is often called the ?pine marten? (which is incorrect.  There is a species known as the ?pine marten? in Europe, which is not the same species as our American marten.), or simply marten.  This is a weasel-like animal, which is generally smaller than a housecat.  They have a highly variable pelage, ranging from a dark red-brown to a pale color, and they typically have a lighter yellow-orange ventral color.  Their tail and legs are typically darker than their bodies (sometimes almost black in color).  They have a pointed snout, and rounded ears.  Total length: 460-750mm, weight: 0.5-1.2kg.  They have semi-retractable claws, which help them in climbing trees.  They typically inhabit subalpine (spruce-fir) and lodgepole pine forests, but have been known to venture into the alpine.  They prefer dense, wooded areas (with usually at least 30% canopy cover).  Martens will den in tree cavities, logs, snags, rock piles and burrows, but frequently rest on tree limbs during the day.  They have a variable diet, including voles, squirrels, mice, rabbits, snowshoe hares, pikas and shrews, and will occasionally take a bird or two.  They are usually active during the twilight hours (crepuscular) or are nocturnal, and are active year-round.  Most breeding occurs between late July and early September.  Like most mustelids, delayed implantation occurs, and the gestation period is from 230-275 days.  Martens only have one litter of an average of three (range 1-5) young per year.  Most mortality occurs due to trapping (they have highly prized pelts), but coyotes, foxes, lynx, mountain lions, eagles and Great Horned Owls have been known to take martens.
