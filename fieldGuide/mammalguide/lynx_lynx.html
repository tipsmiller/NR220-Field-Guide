   <strong>Description:</strong> Roughly the size of a bobcat (though larger in some cases), lynx are a grizzled gray to reddish brown in color, and have a pronounced ruff of fur around the face, and distinct long dark tufts of fur at the top of the ears.  Though they can occasionally have spots and stripes (like a bobcat), these are usually very muted, and not as distinctive as they are in a bobcat.  Lynx have long legs, with large, fur-lined paws that allow them to easily walk in areas of heavy snows.  Total length 670-1,067mm, and weight is 5-15kg.    Lynx have a historical predatory relationship with snowshoe hare, which comprises the vast majority of its yearly diet.  Other prey includes grouse, ptarmigan, pine squirrels, mice, ground squirrels, beavers, muskrats and even young deer and elk. Lynx are usually solitary, and are primarily nocturnal.  They den or bed under ledges, trees, and snags or occasionally in caves.  Lynxes breed in March, April or may, and have a gestation period of nine weeks.  Female lynx produce one litter of an average of three (range of 1 to 6) young annually.  They have few natural enemies, including wolverine and wolves throughout their range.  Recently, the Colorado Division of Wildlife has reintroduced lynx into the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountain ranges in south-central Colorado.  These lynx have traveled as far north as southern Wyoming.
