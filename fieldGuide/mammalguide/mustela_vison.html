   <strong>Description:</strong> Mink are similar in size and shape to the American marten, though mink have less conspicuous rounded ears.  Their pelage is soft and often shiny from water-repellant oils mink generate from special glands at the base of their hairs.  Color ranges from a dark brown to black, with the ventral color only slightly paler.  Some individuals can have small white patches on their throat or at the base of their neck.  Mink tails are about one ?third to one-half the length of their bodies.  Total length is 491-720mm, and weight is 525-750g.  Males average about 10% larger than female, and can weigh almost twice as much.  Mink can be found in practically any habitat type, but are obligate riparian animals, and are seldom found from permanent sources of water (i.e. rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, etc.).  Mink often den in abandoned beaver lodges, and muskrat dens, but do not create dens on their own.  Mink diet varies considerably.  They will consume any number of small mammals and rodents, small rabbits, voles, ground-nesting birds and their eggs, amphibians, lizards, fish, insects, and crayfish (as well as some occasional vegetation, thought to be consumed incidentally with other prey items). Mink breed in late February to early April.  Females will produce one litter per year of one to eight young born in late April and May.  Delayed implantation occurs for females who breed early in the breeding season, and it may not occur for late-breeders.  Mink are active year-round, and can be active at any time of the day (though they are usually diurnal).  They are typically solitary, except during the breeding season.  It is thought that mink are not heavily preyed upon, but have been known to be taken by Great-horned Owls, wolves, fishers and bobcats.  Mink are an important furbearer species, and as a result their greatest factor of mortality is trapping (human harvest).
