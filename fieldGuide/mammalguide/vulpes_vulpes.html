   <strong>Description:</strong> This slender fox with a sharp pointed muzzle and bushy white-tipped tail is common in open woodlands and meadows, preferring edge habitats usually near water.  They have three color phases; red, cross, and silver (with the red phase the most common in the wild).  The red phase has a dorsal color of reddish-yellow with lighter (yellowish to white) under parts.  Cross-phase foxes have a yellowish dorsal color with a dark cross of hairs extending over the back and shoulders.  The silver phase is darker than the two, with black guard hairs with silver tips, giving the pelage a silvery or frosty appearance.  Total length is 940-1045mm, and weight is 3-7kg.  Red foxes are opportunistic and take a wide variety of prey, including ground nesting birds and their eggs, a variety of small mammals and rodents, fruits nuts and berries, as well as carrion and the occasional domestic poultry.  They are generally nocturnal pr crepuscular when hunting, but may forage during the day in the winter months.  Foxes are often found in pairs or small family groups.  Breeding usually occurs in the winter months, and females will produce one litter of for or five young per year (though up to 17 young have been reported).  Humans are the principal source of mortality for red foxes, accounting for up to 90% in some cases.  Coyotes, eagles and bobcats will also kill red foxes.
