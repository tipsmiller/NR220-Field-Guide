   <strong>Description:</strong> Porcupines are Colorado?s second largest rodent.  They have stout bodies with short legs and a thick tail they use as a brace when they climb or perch in trees.  They have long, sharp quills (which are actually modified guard hairs) on their back and tail.  They are a dark color, with the longer guard hairs and quills a pale buff to yellow color.  Younger porcupines are generally lighter in color than adults.   Total length is 640-930mm, and weight is 4-18kg.  Porcupines are mostly associated with coniferous trees in the subalpine, lodgepole, ponderosa and zones.  They are also found in aspen and cottonwood stands.  The mainstay of the porcupine?s diet is the phloem, buds and foliage of shrubs, saplings, and trees.  The cambium, buds, and needles of lodgepole, ponderosa and Douglas-fir trees are especially important food items in Colorado for porcupines.  They often feed on trees by chewing through the outer bark, and eating the soft, inner bark, often removing large sections of bark and even girdling trees in the process.  Porcupines are active at any time of the day or night (but are generally thought of as being nocturnal), year-round.  They are generally solitary, but will concentrate in dens sites during the winter.  Most breeding occurs in fall or early winter.  Females will have a single young per year (though twins have been documented).  When threatened, porcupines generally stay still, taking a hunched position and exposing their quills to the threat.  The quills are loosely attached, but are not ?shot?, and become easily embedded in whatever comes in contact with them.  Native predators include coyotes, lynx, bobcats, mountain lions and black bears, though these animals rarely kill porcupines.
