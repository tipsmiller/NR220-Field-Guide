   <strong>Description:</strong> The striped slunk is a large skunk with a bushy tail and a black background color.  They have a single white stripe that extends from the tip of the nose to the base of the neck, where it splits into two, and continues down the back of the skunk and converges again at the base of the tail.  Total length is 580-770mm, and weight is 1,800-4,500g.  Striped skunks can be found in most habitats in Colorado, except the alpine tundra.  They are most common at lower elevations.  Striped skunks are opportunistic omnivores, dieting on a variety of insects, voles, mice and ground nesting birds and their eggs.  They will also consume berries, fruit, grains and vegetables.  Striped skunks are most active during the twilight hours, and often forage into the night.  They can be seen active during the day, especially during the fall as the animals are trying to gain weight to survive the winter months.  In the summer they will normally sleep in patches of dense vegetation, or in other suitable areas above ground.  During the winter months, however, striped skunks rely on abandoned burrows and dens created by other mammals for cover.  Skunks are capable of digging their own burrows when not other suitable places exist.  During the winter, they are relatively inactive but do not hibernate.  Striped skunks will breed in February or March.  Females produce one litter of five to eight young annually.  Most individuals do not live past about three years of age in the wild.  Great-horned Owls, eagles, mountain lions, bobcats, badgers, coyotes and foxes will prey on striped skunks.  They are well known to spray unwary aggressors.  The offensive odor produced by anal glands is caused by a compound known as mercaptan.
