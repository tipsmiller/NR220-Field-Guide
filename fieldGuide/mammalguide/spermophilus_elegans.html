   <strong>Description:</strong> Wyoming ground squirrels are medium-sized ground squirrels with a fairly long tail.  They are a buff gray color dorsally, with a slightly lighter underside.  The tail is a darker buff color, and has an outline of white or pale tan.  Total length is 250-335mm, and weight is 300-500g.  Wyoming ground squirrels live mainly in the mountain shrub zone, in colonies.  These colonies do not appear to have a particular social structure, and tend to be more of a collection of individuals.  They feed almost exclusively on grasses and forbs, and are generalists in food selection habits.  They will create burrow systems, and can defend these burrows from other ground squirrels, especially during the breeding season (typically spring).  Wyoming ground squirrels mate after emerging from hibernation.  Females have only one litter of 3 to 11 young per year.  They are strictly diurnal, peaking in activity during the early morning.  When alarmed, they give a high-pitched alarm call, followed by a trill as they retreat to their burrow.  Some individuals may begin to hibernate as early as late July, with most individuals hibernating before the end of September.  Wyoming ground squirrels have a high number of natural predators including badgers, raptors, coyotes, bobcats, snakes and weasels.  Because they burrow, often undermining the soil surface, they have been considered as a pest, and historically have been extensively controlled by humans.
