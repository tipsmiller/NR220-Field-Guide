   <strong>Description:</strong> Known locally as "rockchucks" or "whistle-pigs", these stout-bodied ground squirrels have a yellow-brown to tawny color pelage, and a short tail (generally less than one-third its total length).  They have coarse guard hairs and wooly underfur.  There is usually a white band across the face, and the cheeks and sides of the neck are typically a buff color.  Total length is 470-680mm, and total weight 1.6-5.2kg.  Marmots occupy a wide variety of habitats typically above 8,000 ft in elevation.  They eat a variety of forbs, including dandelions, cow parsnip, chiming bells, cinquefoil, and brome.  In areas of lush vegetation, marmots will often crawl on their bellies while they forage, creating distinct beaten-down paths.  They are semifossorial, often digging burrows under rocks or other features that offer protection, and will spend around 80% of their time in these burrows, with about 60% of that time spent in hibernation.  Marmots are diurnal, with peaks of activity in the morning and afternoons.  They have a distinct set of whistles used as calls, and are often heard while traveling in high elevation alpine areas.  Mating probably occurs within two weeks of emergence from hibernation (in the spring months).  Females produce one litter per year, ranging from 3 to 8 young per litter.
