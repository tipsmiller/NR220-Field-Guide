   <strong>Description:</strong> Like the name implies, the least chipmunk is Colorado?s smallest chipmunk.  Color and pattern varies considerably by geographic location, but least chipmunks generally have five dark dorsal stripes, alternating with four stripes of a paler color.  The center dark stripe extends from the top of the head through the end of the tail, and two distinct pale or white stripes are above and below the eye on the face.  Total length is 185-218mm, and weight is 25-60g.  Least chipmunks have a range of habitat greater than any other of Colorado?s chipmunks.  They can be found from the high alpine to the dry deserts of Colorado?s south and west.  They prefer open areas, or areas of edge habitat where they can quickly escape for cover.  Their diet consists mainly of fruits, berries, flowers, seeds, and green vegetation.  They will also occasionally consume animal matter in the form of insects and carrion.  Least chipmunks are active during the day (diurnal), and are most active in the summer months.  They will hibernate for short periods in the winter, arousing to consume stored food items before returning to a state of dormancy.  They will create burrows beneath trees, fallen logs, rocks, bushes and buildings.  They will use these locations to store food, and as platforms for observation.  Most least chipmunks will breed from late March to early July, though the breeding season does vary according to elevation and snow conditions.  Females will have one litter of about four to six young per year.  Weasels. martens, raptors, coyotes, foxes, and bobcats re their primary natural predators.
