   <strong>Description:</strong> The pine squirrel is Colorado?s smallest (and noisiest) tree squirrel.  Their color varies considerably according to location, but is generally a dark gray-brown to charcoal color, with a paler underside and darker tail, and hey have an obvious white ring around their eye.  In the more southern parts of their range, their pelage is a darker reddish-brown color (giving them the nickname of ?red squirrel?).  Pine squirrels are common in most of Colorado?s forests, except stands of ponderosa pine where Abert?s squirrels are present.  Pine squirrels diet consists of a variety of items including seeds, buds and leaves of plants, and fleshy fungi.  They are well known for creating large ?middens? at the base of trees where they feed.  These middens consist mainly of scales of pinecones, cones, and cores of eaten cones, and may reach over 9m across and 0.5m in depth.  Larger middens are usually the result of generations of work by pine squirrels.  Pine squirrels use these middens to cache food for the winter.  They are strongly territorial (most likely as a result of defense of food supplies and caches), and aggressively defend their territories.  Pine squirrels breed from mid-April through mid-July.  Females produce only one litter per year of an average of three young.  Most pine squirrels live to about age 5 in the wild (though in captivity they can live to 10 years).  Their natural predators include martens, fox, lynx, Great-horned Owls, hawks and eagles.
