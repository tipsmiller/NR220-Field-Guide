   <strong>Description:</strong> The western spotted skunk is a small skunk with a dark brown to black base color.  They have a series of broad white stripes from the head to the tail that are broken into spots.  Normally, western spotted skunks have a white spot between the eyes, and a white-tipped tail.  Total length is 340-482mm, and weight is 400-700g.  Western spotted skunk ecology is poorly known in Colorado.  They are typically found in lower elevations of shrub lands, in rocky areas.  They feed on a variety of foods but insects, small mammals and birds consist the main portion of their diet.  The breeding season lasts from September to October.  Delayed implantation occurs and gestation lasts 210 to 230 days.  Females give birth in May to one litter of an average of four young.  Adult western spotted skunks are typically solitary until the breeding season.  They are strictly nocturnal, and are rarely seen.  They den in rock crevices, and sometimes under buildings.  Predators are most likely similar to the striped skunk, and include foxes, coyotes and Great-horned Owls.
